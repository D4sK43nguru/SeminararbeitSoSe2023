    Abstract = {The Enigma machine, invented in 1918, the last year of World War I, served a significant role in the German military and history of cryptography. With the emergence of radio transmission, military communication faced the revolution of a new media. However, manually encrypting messages, possibly leaking intelligence, didn’t meet the military requirement. Encryption machines, which are way more efficient than enciphering messages manually, were in high demand. The Enigma machine was initially to protect commercial privacy. Nazi Germans developed additional mechanisms to adapt to the battlefield. Breaking down the Enigma machine was among the top priorities for the Allies. Because of its crucial rule in cryptography, it is meaningful to examine and explore the Enigma machine. The Enigma encryption scheme was one of the first encryption schemes involving electromechanics, and learning the structure, principle of it can inspire future encryption schemes.

Applications include integrity protection, conventional message authentication and digital signatures. Theoretical results on cryptographic hash functions are reviewed. The information theoretic approach to authentication is described, and the practicality of schemes based on universal hash functions is studied. An overview is given of the complexity theoretic definitions and constructions. The main contribution of this thesis lies in the study of practical constructions for hash functions. A general model for hash functions is proposed and a taxonomy for attacks is presented. Then all schemes in the literature are divided into three classes: hash functions based on block ciphers, hash functions based on modular arithmetic and dedicated hash functions. An overview is given of existing attacks, new attacks are demonstrated, and new schemes are proposed. The study of basic building blocks of cryptographic hash functions leads to the study of the cryptographic properties of Boolean functions. New criteria are defined and functions satisfying new and existing criteria are studied.},

    Central to the secure operation of a public key infrastructure (PKI) is the ability to revoke certificates. While much of users' security rests on this process taking place quickly, in practice, revocation typically requires a human to decide to reissue a new certificate and revoke the old one. Thus, having a proper understanding of how often systems administrators reissue and revoke certificates is crucial to understanding the integrity of a PKI. Unfortunately, this is typically difficult to measure: while it is relatively easy to determine when a certificate is revoked, it is difficult to determine whether and when an administrator should have revoked.In this paper, we use a recent widespread security vulnerability as a natural experiment. Publicly announced in April 2014, the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug, potentially (and undetectably) revealed servers' private keys. Administrators of servers that were susceptible to Heartbleed should have revoked their certificates and reissued new ones, ideally as soon as the vulnerability was publicly announced.Using a set of all certificates advertised by the Alexa Top 1 Million domains over a period of six months, we explore the patterns of reissuing and revoking certificates in the wake of Heartbleed. We find that over 73\% of vulnerable certificates had yet to be reissued and over 87\% had yet to be revoked three weeks after Heartbleed was disclosed. Moreover, our results show a drastic decline in revocations on the weekends, even immediately following the Heartbleed announcement. These results are an important step in understanding the manual processes on which users rely for secure, authenticated communication.},

    The main objective of the research is the analysis of the practical applicability of the cryptographically secure software Blum-Blum-Shub pseudo-random number generator for different authentication and encryption tasks. It is shown that the considered pseudo-random sequence generator, which has a high computational complexity, can be effectively used in those cryptographic tasks, which require low key generation rate. An alternative way of implementing the Password-Based Key Derivation Function, which is based on the use of the Blum-Blum-Shub generator as a pseudo-random function, is proposed. The proposed algorithm allows to slow down dictionary and brute-force attacks. Experimental studies have shown that the developed algorithm allows to adaptively adjust the guaranteed minimum time of generating a cryptographic key for specific tasks of authentication and encryption.},

HTTPS authenticates the communicating end points and provides confidentiality for the ensuing communication. However, as with any security solution, it does not come for free. HTTPS may introduce overhead in terms of infrastructure costs, communication latency, data usage, and energy consumption. Moreover, given the opaqueness of the encrypted communication, any in-network value added services requiring visibility into application layer content, such as caches and virus scanners, become ineffective.This paper attempts to shed some light on these costs. First, taking advantage of datasets collected from large ISPs, we examine the accelerating adoption of HTTPS over the last three years. Second, we quantify the direct and indirect costs of this evolution. Our results show that, indeed, security does not come for free. This work thus aims to stimulate discussion on technologies that can mitigate the costs of HTTPS while still protecting the user's privacy.},

This web-based single sign-on (SSO) scheme is enabled by OAuth 2.0, a web resource authorization protocol that has been adopted by major service providers. The OAuth 2.0 protocol has proven secure by several formal methods, but whether it is indeed secure in practice remains an open question. We examine the implementations of three major OAuth identity providers (IdP) (Facebook, Microsoft, and Google) and 96 popular RP websites that support the use of Facebook accounts for login. Our results uncover several critical vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim user's profile and social graph, and impersonate the victim on the RP website. Closer examination reveals that these vulnerabilities are caused by a set of design decisions that trade security for implementation simplicity. To improve the security of OAuth 2.0 SSO systems in real-world settings, we suggest simple and practical improvements to the design and implementation of IdPs and RPs that can be adopted gradually by individual sites.},

This motivated the use of additional authentication mechanisms in so-called multi-factor authentication protocols. In this article, we define a detailed threat model for this kind of protocol: While in classical protocol analysis attackers control the communication network, we take into account that many communications are performed over TLS channels, that computers may be infected by different kinds of malware, that attackers could perform phishing, and that humans may omit some actions. We formalize this model in the applied pi calculus and perform an extensive analysis and comparison of several widely used protocols—variants of Google 2-step and FIDO’s U2F (Yubico’s Security Key token). The analysis is completely automated, generating systematically all combinations of threat scenarios for each of the protocols and using the PROVERIF tool for automated protocol analysis. To validate our model and attacks, we demonstrate their feasibility in practice, even though our experiments are run in a laboratory environment. Our analysis highlights weaknesses and strengths of the different protocols. It allows us to suggest several small modifications of the existing protocols that are easy to implement, as well as an extension of Google 2-step that improves security in several threat scenarios.},

Techniques like pattern matching, software testing and grammar analysis etc. are frequently used to prevent such attack. However, major bottlenecks still remain in detecting SQLIA with bypassing techniques, getting access to source code and requiring an additional manual operation to extract features. The authors propose a novel detection approach based on long short-term memory and abstract syntax tree, which could detect SQLIAs from the raw query strings and work under SQL detection bypassing scenario. Our deep learning technique explicitly uses both context and syntax information that previous methods failed to fully grasp. Experimental results clearly illustrate the superior performance of our method compared to other existing works when detecting with complete SQL raw queries.},

Such attacks target databases that are accessible through a web front-end, and take advantage of flaws in the input validation logic of Web components such as CGI scripts. We apply the concept of instruction-set randomization to SQL, creating instances of the language that are unpredictable to the attacker. Queries injected by the attacker will be caught and terminated by the database parser. We show how to use this technique with the MySQL database using an intermediary proxy that translates the random SQL to its standard language. Our mechanism imposes negligible performance overhead to query processing and can be easily retrofitted to existing systems.},
